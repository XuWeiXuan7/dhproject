                        the United States is the fear of echo chambers or people operating in media bubbles. If people

                        Interestingly, research largely shows the vast majority of people don’t inhabit perfectly
                        sealed-off echo chambers. It’s been found that only about 4 percent of people operate in online
                        echo chambers, and most people on Twitter, for example, don’t follow any political accounts.

                        Essentially, most people aren’t following politics, and a lot of people who do are getting at
                        least a little bit of information from different sides of the political spectrum. That said,
                        echo chambers and media bubbles are an issue because they can radicalize people, negatively
                        affect the people who inhabit them, and distort the broader political landscape.
                        Wojcieszak says because these people are so politically involved, they have a disproportionate
                        influence on American politics. They’re often the loudest voices in the room.

                <p>She says people who are politically active like to have their views confirmed, so they can end up
                    following accounts that align with their views and end up in echo chambers. Social media makes it
                    easier to find people who align with them politically, and algorithms often feed them the content
                    they’re going to like. All of this can ultimately lead to people going down rabbit holes and
                    becoming more politically extreme.
                    “It makes you more extreme or polarized. It reinforces your attitudes. It also reinforces your sense
                    of belonging to this group, and it reinforces your negativity and hostility toward other groups,”
                    Wojcieszak says. “You think you’re the legitimate one, the good one, the virtuous one. The others
                    are evil.”
                    People can start to believe they’re the only ones with the facts and that the other side is
                    illegitimate. (Perhaps you’ve seen this in a person who paid tens of billions of dollars for a
                    social media company not long ago.) Wojcieszak says the process of people becoming radicalized can
                    start with them having just a few political views in common with those who are more extreme than
                    they are. Having a few stances that align with these extreme actors online can be the snare that
                    pulls them into the rabbit hole.</p>

                        “In order to enter that process of this individual psychological and algorithmic confirmation,
                        you do need to have some extent of susceptibility to some sort of narratives from the left or
                        the right,” Wojcieszak says. “If there are some social or political issues in which you have
                        some views, that can start the process.”
                        You can imagine someone who isn’t particularly politically extreme but does harbor certain fears
                        about ways the country is changing being pulled in by extremists and becoming extreme themselves
                        as they get increasingly embedded in that community. People need community, and extremists can
                        give them that. They’ll be welcomed by this community, Wojcieszak says, and they’ll feel the
                        psychological need to start going along with whatever that community’s narrative is on any
                        number of issues.

                <p>Mike Gruszczynski, an assistant professor of communication science at Indiana University, says a
                    distrust in institutions, such as news media and the government, can lead to people creating echo
                    chambers and often falling for disinformation because it appeals to their political beliefs. He says
                    this has been found to be more common on the political right than the political left.

                    “You have a lot of people on the right wing of the political spectrum who have been highly
                    distrustful of traditional journalism for quite a while,” Gruszczynski says. “Not only are they
                    distrustful of it, but they exist in a kind of feedback loop where their chosen leaders tell them
                    that the things that come out of the media are false or biased.”
                    One of the ways society can help prevent people from going down these rabbit holes and becoming more
                    extreme is by teaching them media literacy. Gruszczynski says it won’t necessarily be easy to do,
                    especially because there’s so much disinformation out there and it’s often quite convincing. But
                    it’d be worth the effort. “Everyone kind of has to be their own detective in a way now,”
                    Gruszczynski says.

                    <p>It often feels like an insurmountable challenge, Wojcieszak says, because those who have become
                        politically extreme are living in such a different reality than the rest of the populace. If
                        someone
                        is spending most of their time on extremist forums or in extreme groups on social media, for
                        example, it’s hard to reach them and bring them back to reality. She says improving social media
                        algorithms so these platforms are less likely to make people more extreme in the first place
                        could
                        be a good place to start when it comes to attacking this problem.

                        “In the US, things have gotten so deeply bad for some groups. The people who are, say, true
                        Trump
                        believers or who are convinced Covid was a hoax—I’m not sure if you can deprogram them,”
                        Wojcieszak
                        says.
                        Society may not be able to pull everyone out of these rabbit holes, but increased media literacy
                        and
                        social media platforms that aren’t designed to confirm people’s existing beliefs and make them
                        more
                        extreme could help fewer people become radicalized. It’s a widespread problem that will take
                        time to
                        address, but the status quo does not seem sustainable.
